Shipping Insurance
Pips 'n Chicks offers an optional shipping insurance to provide buyers  - if a package is damaged, significantly delayed, or lost in transit, resulting in the death of live birds or complete inviability of eggs, we will issue a full refund to the buyer at no cost to the seller or buyer.
What is Covered?
Severe shipping delays (e.g., a package held in transit for an extended period, leading to total egg inviability or harm to live birds).
Lost or misrouted packages that result in the death of birds or eggs rendered completely non-viable.
Packages that arrive severely damaged due to mishandling by USPS, causing total loss.
What is Not Covered?
Low hatch rates not directly caused by shipping. Fertility and hatchability are influenced by multiple factors beyond our control.
Minor delays that do not result in a complete loss of viability.
Issues unrelated to shipping, such as improper incubation or care after delivery.
Pips 'n Chicks reserves the right to evaluate claims and make all final decisions regarding insurance payouts. Our priority is ensuring proper animal care from egg to adulthood, and this insurance is designed to protect against preventable losses due to USPS-related shipping failures.
