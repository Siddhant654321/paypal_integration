# Getting started

### How PayPal Checkout works

Integrate PayPal Checkout to give your customers payment buttons for PayPal, Venmo, debit, and credit cards.

PayPal's JavaScript SDK supports how you want to accept payments on your website. Our SDK handles displaying the buttons for PayPal and other payment methods, so your customers can pay with whatever method they choose. They can also use a pre-built form to pay directly using credit or debit.

The JavaScript payload shows up in the global window object under the paypal namespace, so you can access it anywhere in your app to render any component in the JavaScript SDK.

Workflow for integrating PayPal Checkout.

1

The <script> tag fetches the PayPal SDK when your checkout page renders.

2

When your customer clicks on a PayPal button, the createOrder callback tells your server to initiate an order with PayPal's server.

3

PayPal returns an Order ID to the SDK, launching a pop-up window.

4

The customer logs in using PayPal credentials and uses the order review page to verify order details and check out.

5

The onApprove callback launches after payment is confirmed.

6

You can use the response to verify the payment was completed or catch any errors about their payment method.

The PayPal buttons component shows up on your website based on the configuration you set in the JavaScript SDK. Your buyer can choose how to check out based on the eligible payment methods. A buyer following the PayPal Checkout flow sees the **PayPal**, **Venmo**, and **Debit or Credit Card** buttons.

When your buyer selects a payment method:

1

A pop-up shows up on the buyer's screen.

2

If the buyer is logged into their PayPal account, the pop-up includes details about their order.

3

This screen shows the buyer's default shipping address and the default shipping option you selected in the initial Orders API call.

4

The buyer can choose a different shipping address and payment method.

5

The buyer confirms that all the information is correct.

6

The buyer selects Complete Purchase to authorize the payment.

7

The order goes to PayPal's servers, where we process the payment.

## Set up your development environment

scroll leftscroll right

1

Build the server

This sample Node.js integration uses the npm package manager.

Enter `npm install` to run the sample application. For more information, [visit npm's documentation.](https://www.npmjs.com/)

2

Install dependencies

Set up your integration by running `npm install @paypal/paypal-server-sdk@0.6.0 dotenv express body-parser` to install the following 4 libraries at the same time:

- [@paypal/paypal-server-sdk@0.6.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paypal/paypal-server-sdk/v/0.5.1) The PayPal Server SDK provides integration access to the PayPal REST APIs


- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) separates your configuration and code by loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.


- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is a Node.js web application framework that supports web and mobile applications.


- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) is used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers



This sample integration uses PayPal's Server SDK v0.6.0. For more details, visit [the PayPal Server SDK documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/serversdk) by logging in to your account.

3

Verify package.json

The following code sample shows a package.json file for a PayPal integration. Replace `YOUR-SERVER-NAME.js` with the name of your server file in main and start on lines 5 and 8:

{

    "name": "paypal-checkout-integration-backend-node",

    "version": "1.0.0",

    "private": true,

    "type": "module",

    "dependencies": {

        "@paypal/paypal-server-sdk": "^0.6.0",

        "body-parser": "^1.20.3",

        "dotenv": "^16.3.1",

        "express": "^4.18.2"

    },

    "scripts": {

        "server-dev": "nodemon server.js",

        "start": "npm run server-dev",

        "prod": "node server.js",

        "format": "npx prettier --write \*\*/\*.{js,jsx,md}",

        "format:check": "npx prettier --check \*\*/\*.{js,jsx,md}"

    },

    "devDependencies": {

        "concurrently": "^8.2.1",

        "nodemon": "^3.0.1"

    }

}

If you're having trouble with your app, reinstall your local library and package files using `npm install`. If you're getting the following node error, include `"type": "module"` in your package.json file. This line isn't automatically added when package.json is created.

Warning: To load an ES module, set `"type": "module"` in the package.json file or use the .mjs extension. Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created.

See line 5 of the sample package.json file for an example.

Set up environment variables

Update your operating system's local working environment variables to pass your app's client ID and client secret securely. The following examples show how to set up these environment variables in PowerShell on Windows, as well as the Linux and MacOS operating systems:

Windows (powershell)

    $env:PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_ID = "<PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_ID>"

    $env:PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_SECRET = "<PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_SECRET>"

Linux / MacOS

    export PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_ID="<PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_ID>"

    export PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_SECRET="<PAYPAL\_CLIENT\_SECRET>"

View your client ID and client secret in the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.paypal.com%2Fdashboard%2F&intent=developer&ctxId=ul642d80e87cb74e0ea12c423476c5ea50) under **Apps & Creden** **tials.**

Know before you code

Sign up for a developer account

You need a PayPal developer account to get sandbox credentials.

Manage sandbox accounts

You can create a personal or business sandbox account using your production account.

Create business or personal sandbox accounts

You can create additional sandbox accounts from your Developer Dashboard.

Get your credentials

Follow this onboarding document to get a client ID, client secret, access token, and sandbox account credentials:

* * *

**Client ID:** Authenticates your account with PayPal and identifies an app in your sandbox.

* * *

**Client secret:** Authorizes an app in your sandbox. Keep this secret safe and don't share it

* * *

**Access token:** Authenticates your app when calling PayPal REST API

Resources
